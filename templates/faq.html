<h1>FAQ</h1>
<div class="question">How do I play the game?</div>
<div class="answer">The game starts in the game's lobby. Note that this is <b>not</b> #ircpuzzles. When a game starts, the lobby will be announced in #ircpuzzles. The namespace for the competition stays the same throughout the competition. If the namespace is "#######", all competition channels including the lobby will begin with "#######". To get to the next level, you must solve the level you are on. The next level's name is the solution to the current level. Of course, the solutions will follow IRC channel format (non case sensitive, no spaces), and begin with the competition prefix.</div>{% endblock %}
